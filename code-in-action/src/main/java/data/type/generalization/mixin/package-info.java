 * Sometimes described as being included rather than inherited
 * Advantages:
 * 1. provides a mechanism for multiple inheritance
 * 2. code reusability
 *
 * Implementation in Java:
 * 1. Use interfaces: {@link data.type.generalization.mixin.InterfaceMixin}
 * 2. Use Decorator Pattern: {@link data.type.generalization.mixin.DecoratorMixin}
 * 3. Use Dynamic Proxy: {@link data.type.generalization.mixin.DynamicProxyMixin}
